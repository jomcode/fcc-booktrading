    "description": "The third edition of this standard textbook of modern graph theory has been carefully revised, updated, and substantially extended. Covering all its major recent developments it can be used both as a reliable textbook for an introductory course and as a graduate text: on each topic it covers all the basic material in full detail, and adds one or two deeper results (again with detailed proofs) to illustrate the more advanced methods of that field. From the reviews of the first two editions (1997, 2000): \"This outstanding book cannot be substituted with any other book on the present textbook market. It has every chance of becoming the standard textbook for graph theory.\" Acta Scientiarum Mathematiciarum \"The book has received a very enthusiastic reception, which it amply deserves. A masterly elucidation of modern graph theory.\" Bulletin of the Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications \"A highlight of the book is what is by far the best account in print of the Seymour-Robertson theory of graph minors.\" Mathematika \". . . like listening to someone explain mathematics.\" Bulletin of the AMS",

    "description": "Graphs have become a fixture of everyday life, used in scientific and business publications, in magazines and newspapers, on television, on billboards, and even on cereal boxes. Nonetheless, surprisingly few graphs communicate effectively, and most graphs fail because they do not take into account the goals, needs, and abilities of the viewers. In raph Design for Eye and Mind, Stephen Kosslyn addresses these problems by presenting eight psychological principles for constructing effective graphs. Each principle is solidly rooted both in the scientific literature on how we perceive and comprehend graphs and in general facts about how our eyes and brains process visual information. Graph Design for Eye and Mind is an invaluable reference for anyone who uses visual displays to convey information in the sciences, humanities, and businesses such as finance, marketing, and advertising.",

The structure is unchanged, but the text has been clarified and the notation brought into line with current practice. A large number of 'Additional Results' are included at the end of each chapter, thereby covering most of the major advances in the last twenty years. Professor Biggs' basic aim remains to express properties of graphs in algebraic terms, then to deduce theorems about them. In the first part, he tackles the applications of linear algebra and matrix theory to the study of graphs; algebraic constructions such as adjacency matrix and the incidence matrix and their applications are discussed in depth. There follows an extensive account of the theory of chromatic polynomials, a subject which has strong links with the 'interaction models' studied in theoretical physics, and the theory of knots. The last part deals with symmetry and regularity properties. Here there are important connections with other branches of algebraic combinatorics and group theory. This new and enlarged edition this will be essential reading for a wide range of mathematicians, computer scientists and theoretical physicists.",

    "description": "Study of \"graph operators\" or \"graph-valued functions\" such as the line graph, the clique graph, the complement, and powers, raises several immediate questions: Which graphs are fixed under the operator? Which graphs appear as images of graphs? What happens if the operator is iterated? Over the last 30 years these questions have been answered and methods developed for particular operators in literally hundreds of papers on the subject. Nowhere, however, could one find a comprehensive treatment-a unification of terminology, questions, and methods. Graph Dynamics provides that comprehensive treatment. Its purpose is threefold: it serves as an introductory textbook on the topic, offers an encyclopedic survey of the literature, and reports recent research-both new tools and results on concrete operators. Part I explicitly presents graph dynamics general theory, stating general principles illustrated by application to graph operators. Part 2 addresses the operators themselves. It lists all known graph operators grouped together in families and recounts, with complete references, all that is known about the dynamical behavior of these concrete operators. Graph Dynamics is the book you need if you are looking for information on a particular operator, need a text for advanced students, or want to review collected research results presented with a common terminology. It is clearly an essential resource for anyone working in or studying algebra, combinatorics, or graph theory.",

Important matrices associated with graphs (for example, incidence, adjacency and Laplacian matrices) are treated in detail. Presenting a useful overview of selected topics in algebraic graph theory, early chapters of the text focus on regular graphs, algebraic connectivity, the distance matrix of a tree, and its generalized version for arbitrary graphs, known as the resistance matrix. Coverage of later topics include Laplacian eigenvalues of threshold graphs, the positive definite completion problem and matrix games based on a graph. Such an extensive coverage of the subject area provides a welcome prompt for further exploration. The inclusion of exercises enables practical learning throughout the book. In the new edition, a new chapter is added on the line graph of a tree, while some results in Chapter 6 on Perron-Frobenius theory are reorganized. Whilst this book will be invaluable to students and researchers in graph theory and combinatorial matrix theory, it will also benefit readers in the sciences and engineering.",

Maziark in Isis) 'Biggs, Lloyd and Wilson's unusual and remarkable book traces the evolution and development of graph theory...Conceived in a very original manner and obviously written with devotion and a very great amount of painstaking historical research, it contains an exceptionally fine collection of source material, and to a graph theorist it is a treasure chest of fascinating historical information and curiosities with rich food for thought.' (Gabriel Dirac in Centaurus) 'The lucidity, grace and wit of the writing makes this book a pleasure to read and re-read.' (S. H. Hollingdale in Bulletin of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications)",

Chapter 1 focuses on finite graph theory, including trees, planarity, coloring, matchings, and Ramsey theory. Chapter 2 studies combinatorics, including the principle of inclusion and exclusion, generating functions, recurrence relations, Pólya theory, the stable marriage problem, and several important classes of numbers. Chapter 3 presents infinite pigeonhole principles, König's lemma, and Ramsey's theorem, and discusses their connections to axiomatic set theory. The text is written in an enthusiastic and lively style. It includes results and problems that cross subdisciplines, emphasizing relationships between different areas of mathematics. In addition, recent results appear in the text, illustrating the fact that mathematics is a living discipline. The text is primarily directed toward upper-division undergraduate students, but lower-division undergraduates with a penchant for proof and graduate students seeking an introduction to these subjects will also find much of interest.",

In addition to a modern treatment of the classical areas of graph theory, the book presents a detailed account of newer topics, including Szemerédis Regularity Lemma and its use, Shelahs extension of the Hales-Jewett Theorem, the precise nature of the phase transition in a random graph process, the connection between electrical networks and random walks on graphs, and the Tutte polynomial and its cousins in knot theory. Moreover, the book contains over 600 well thought-out exercises: although some are straightforward, most are substantial, and some will stretch even the most able reader.",

Both developments are centred on Cayley graphs: in the design of large interconnection networks, Cayley graphs arise as one of the most frequently used models; on the mathematical side, they play a central role as the prototypes of vertex-transitive graphs. The surveys published here provide an account of these developments, with a strong emphasis on the fruitful interplay of methods from group theory and graph theory that characterises the subject. Topics covered include: combinatorial properties of various hierarchical families of Cayley graphs (fault tolerance, diameter, routing, forwarding indices, etc.); Laplace eigenvalues of graphs and their relations to forwarding problems, isoperimetric properties, partition problems, and random walks on graphs; vertex-transitive graphs of small orders and of orders having few prime factors; distance transitive graphs; isomorphism problems for Cayley graphs of cyclic groups; infinite vertex-transitive graphs (the random graph and generalisations, actions of the automorphisms on ray ends, relations to the growth rate of the graph).",

For many years now, graph theory has been developing at a great pace and in many directions. In order to emphasize the variety of questions and to preserve the freshness of research, the theme of the meeting was not restricted. Consequently, the papers in this volume deal with many aspects of graph theory, including colouring, connectivity, cycles, Ramsey theory, random graphs, flows, simplicial decompositions and directed graphs. A number of other papers are concerned with related areas, including hypergraphs, designs, algorithms, games and social models. This wealth of topics should enhance the attractiveness of the volume.",

After introducing key tools required for the study of web graph mathematics, an overview is given of the most widely studied models for the web graph. A discussion of popular web search algorithms, e.g. PageRank, is followed by additional topics, such as applications of infinite graph theory to the web graph, spectral properties of power law graphs, domination in the web graph, and the spread of viruses in networks. The book is based on a graduate course taught at the AARMS 2006 Summer School at Dalhousie University. As such it is self-contained and includes over 100 exercises. The reader of the book will gain a working knowledge of current research in graph theory and its modern applications. In addition, the reader will learn first-hand about models of the web, and the mathematics underlying modern search engines.\"--Publisher's description.",

Because any complex network can be represented by a graph, and therefore in turn by a matrix, graph theory has become a powerful tool in the investigation of network performance. This self-contained 2010 book provides a concise introduction to the theory of graph spectra and its applications to the study of complex networks. Covering a range of types of graphs and topics important to the analysis of complex systems, this guide provides the mathematical foundation needed to understand and apply spectral insight to real-world systems. In particular, the general properties of both the adjacency and Laplacian spectrum of graphs are derived and applied to complex networks.

    "description": "Once again, Robert Sedgewick provides a current and comprehensive introduction to important algorithms. The focus this time is on graph algorithms, which are increasingly critical for a wide range of applications, such as network connectivity, circuit design, scheduling, transaction processing, and resource allocation. In this book, Sedgewick offers the same successful blend of theory and practice with concise implementations that can be tested on real applications, which has made his work popular with programmers for many years. Algorithms in C, Third Edition, Part 5: Graph Algorithms is the second book in Sedgewick's thoroughly revised and rewritten series. The first book, Parts 1-4, addresses fundamental algorithms, data structures, sorting, and searching. A forthcoming third book will focus on strings, geometry, and a range of advanced algorithms. Each book's expanded coverage features new algorithms and implementations, enhanced descriptions and diagrams, and a wealth of new exercises for polishing skills. A focus on abstract data types makes the programs more broadly useful and relevant for the modern object-oriented programming environment. Coverage includes: A complete overview of graph properties and types Diagraphs and DAGs Minimum spanning trees Shortest paths Network flows Diagrams, sample C code, and detailed algorithm descriptions The Web site for this book (http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rs/) provides additional source code for programmers along with numerous support materials for educators. A landmark revision, Algorithms in C, Third Edition, Part 5 provides a complete tool set for programmers to implement, debug, and use graph algorithms across a wide range of computer applications.",

    "description": "The book, suitable as both an introductory reference and as a text book in the rapidly growing field of topological graph theory, models both maps (as in map-coloring problems) and groups by means of graph imbeddings on sufaces. Automorphism groups of both graphs and maps are studied. In addition connections are made to other areas of mathematics, such as hypergraphs, block designs, finite geometries, and finite fields. There are chapters on the emerging subfields of enumerative topological graph theory and random topological graph theory, as well as a chapter on the composition of English church-bell music. The latter is facilitated by imbedding the right graph of the right group on an appropriate surface, with suitable symmetries. Throughout the emphasis is on Cayley maps: imbeddings of Cayley graphs for finite groups as (possibly branched) covering projections of surface imbeddings of loop graphs with one vertex. This is not as restrictive as it might sound; many developments in topological graph theory involve such imbeddings. The approach aims to make all this interconnected material readily accessible to a beginning graduate (or an advanced undergraduate) student, while at the same time providing the research mathematician with a useful reference book in topological graph theory. The focus will be on beautiful connections, both elementary and deep, within mathematics that can best be described by the intuitively pleasing device of imbedding graphs of groups on surfaces.",
